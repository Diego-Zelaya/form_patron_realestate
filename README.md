Requirement:
1. Need a PHP engine to run the php code, so install it locally using Apache/PHP

Provides some of my developing style to develop dynamic Web-based applications. Using PHP with HTML/CSS, creating functions, and integrating with databases using MySQL.
The code in itself will need to be put into functions to help others looking at your code, I did not did not create the functions on this version (gotta hold something back) But this should start you in the right direction. This was created for a buisness client on a private project.
